# Gruff

A DSL for generating GraphQL queries

## Status: alpha

* Was written in a hurry because I needed it for work:
  * Needs (better) tests and documentation
  * Best understood by just reading its code and noting the types
* Missing: fragments, enums, schema definitions

## Usage

Add to your deps:

```elixir
{:gruff, git: "https://github.com/irresponsible/gruff", branch: "master"}
```
